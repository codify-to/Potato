# In Potato, you can use the I18n helper function "_". 
# For example, use _("title") to display the content define below.
title: My Application

# Most of the time, quotation marks are optional in YAML
subtitle: "The greatest application the world has ever seen"

# Beautiful HTML syntax without escaping or dreaded CDATA tags ^^
my_html: <p>This is a <b>bold</b> statement!</p>

# Dynamic string to be subtituted with the printf function
# Notice the substitution symbols %(product)s and %(cost)s
dynamic_example: "Do you want to <b>buy a %(product)s</b>? Buy it today for only <b>US$ %(cost)s</b>!" 

# Example of multiline YAML, starting with a pipe (" | ")
multiline_example: |
  First line with introductory text, followed
  by a second Line, maybe we should add
  a third line just to be certain multiline fields work.

# Fill with locale - MATCH_BY_TEXT
